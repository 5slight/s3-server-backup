# s3-server-backup
A tool to setup with CRON on a server to back it up to Amazon S3. This is designed to be run everyday and will create nightly and weekly backups with an option of how many of each too retain. It works by creating a temparary archive in `/tmp` then copys that to S3 and deletes the left overs.
